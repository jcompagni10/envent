# Eventful

## Background and Overview

Events, large or small in scale, have always had to address the problem of
how information is communicated to all attendees. Eventful strives to solve
this problem by providing a mobile application that keeps event attendees
up to date with news, updates, and general scheduling of events.

## Functionality & MVP

This application will be able to:
- [ ] Create new events
- [ ] Assign specific components for the event(message board, calendar, events, tags etc.)
- [ ] Enables guests to access channel of event they are attending

#### Bonus Features
- [ ] Enable private events to use special key to access channel
- [ ] Allow admins to assign moderators
- [ ] Handle ticketing/proof of invitation

## Technologies / Technical Challenges
Backend : Rails, PostgreSQL

Frontend : React/Redux, React Native


#### Challenges
##### Dynamically Creating Tables
As users create events, they are able to customize the components for their events. We need then for the information that they input via checkboxes to translate to the creation of the tables in the backend.
